This repository contains the ongoing development of the **Densetsu Engine**, support tools, experimental systems, and prototype gameplay elements for the world of **Densetsu**. It serves as a central place to organize engine logic, testing modules, documentation, and research powering the larger Densetsu project.

The ***DENSETSU ENGINE*** will reside here. it is free for everyone, forever. The games made in it further along the way, however, **won't** .

## About This Project

Densetsu is a long-term fantasy IP spanning multiple media formats including games, comics, worldbuilding documents, and concept art. The engine and scripts contained in this repository form the technical backbone of the main game and related tools.

The goals of this repository include:

* Building a modular, character-driven **2D action-RPG engine** in Godot
* Experimenting with **actor systems**, **FSMs**, **AI behavior**, and **environment systems**
* Hosting prototypes and test scenes for movement, combat, and interactions
* Organizing working documents and technical notes
* Providing foundations for expanded Densetsu media and gameplay

## Personal Contribution Statement

This repository reflects a vast amount of iterative work, testing, and experimentation — but the code itself is 99% ChatGPT - I'm a game designer, not a coder.

### **What I did:**

* **Game design & planning**
* **Engine architecture**
* **Extensive testing, debugging, hallucination control, and QA** (with CyberSpaceGod)

This project exists because of intensive design iteration, testing discipline, and collaborative refinement — not because I wrote the code. Any technical progress here is the result of steering, checking, validating, and shaping the systems that the engine depends on.

## Project Scope

The repository may include:

* Actor system prototypes
* State machine drafts
* Movement and combat experiments
* Environment system tests
* Editor and tool experiments
* Documentation exports
* Systems integration experiments (FSM + stats + actor core)

This is **NOT** the final engine nor the full game. It is the construction site from which those things will emerge.

---

## Philosophy

Densetsu is built on:

* **Strong design direction**
* **Human-authored creativity**
* **Transparent iteration**
* **Modular systems that can scale**
* **A long-term vision for a fully realized IP**

This repository mirrors that: evolving, refining, breaking, fixing, and gradually forming the larger structure of the Densetsu Engine.
