# Platform+ Enhanced Movement Behavior

Platform+ is an advanced platformer movement behavior for Construct 2/3, designed to provide modern, professional-grade character movement for 2D platformer games. It is a drop-in replacement and major upgrade for the original Platform+ behavior, offering a wide range of new features and configurability for both developers and players.

## What Makes This Version Special?

This fork is a **comprehensive refactor and feature expansion** of the original Platform+ behavior. It includes all the classic features (walk, jump, double jump, wall jump, moving platforms, etc.) and adds a huge set of new, modern platformer mechanics:

- **Dash System**: Horizontal, air, and 8-directional dashes with configurable speed, duration, cooldown, and gravity reduction.
- **Slide & Rolling System**: Momentum-based sliding, rolling, and slope physics with dynamic collision height and friction.
- **Coyote Time & Jump Buffering**: Ultra-responsive controls for professional game feel.
- **Fast Fall & Ground Pound**: Configurable gravity multipliers and impact detection.
- **Multi-Jump System**: Any number of jumps (single, double, triple, unlimited) with full integration.
- **Slope Physics**: Realistic, per-degree slope effects for both walking and sliding/rolling, with momentum conservation.
- **Wall Slide & Improved Wall Jump**: Modern wall sliding and property-driven wall jump force.
- **Property-Driven Design**: All features are fully configurable and can be enabled/disabled at runtime. Backward compatibility is maintained—existing projects work unchanged.
- **Performance Optimized**: All features are implemented at the behavior level for maximum efficiency and minimal event sheet complexity.

## Refactor & Feature Expansion Credits

This refactor and feature expansion was planned, implemented, and documented by **Dalton Sterritt**. The work is based on the original Platform+ by Pode and the Construct 2/3 community, but all new features, bug fixes, and architectural improvements in this fork are the result of Dalton Sterritt's ongoing development and refactor plan.

See `refactor-plan.md` for a detailed breakdown of all new features, technical implementation notes, and migration strategies.
